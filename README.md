The simple multiplayer 2D tanks game in Python, developed with my kids.  

#### COMPATIBILITY
- developed with Python 3.11.2  
  It's a pity that Debian Wheezy and Raspi OS are delaying to get to Py 12+ so my generics are not so nice in the code as I would wish

#### REQUIREMENTS
- pygame
- pyyaml

#### CONFIGURE
See src/tanks.yaml
        
#### USAGE
- cd src
- run server.py
- run tanks.py for each client that desires to play

#### TODO
- edit sprite sketches, add transparency
- add screenshot of game here, in readme
- tanks of different colors for different players
- fix comment vanishing in yaml after save, always save with unix-style line breaks
