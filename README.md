The simple multiplayer 2D tanks game in Python, developed with my kids.  

#### COMPATIBILITY
- Python 3.11.2 or later (it's a pity that Debian Wheezy and Raspi OS are delaying to get to Py 12+ so my generics are not so beautiful in the code as I would wish)

#### REQUIREMENTS
- pygame
- pyyaml

#### CONFIGURE
See tanks.yaml
        
#### USAGE
- cd src
- start server.py
- start tanks.py for each client desired to play

#### TODO
- edit sprite sketches, add transparency
- explode missles when they collide with each other
- add screenshot of game here, in readme
